**3A: Analyze Use Case**

**Goal:** To develop a tool or workflow that enables users to calculate the total cost of a project from a BIM model.

**Model Use (BIM Uses):** Cost estimation is a critical process in all construction projects. By calculating the total cost of a project in the early stages of design, users can identify and mitigate potential cost overruns. BIM models provide a rich source of data for cost estimation, including information about the materials, labor, and equipment required to complete a project.

**3B: Propose a (Design for a) Tool / Workflow**

**Process Diagram:** The following BPMN diagram illustrates the proposed workflow for calculating the total cost of a project from a BIM model:

[Insert BPMN diagram here]

**Description of the process:**

1. The user opens the BIM model in the tool.
2. The tool extracts the relevant data from the BIM model, such as the quantities of materials, labor, and equipment required to complete the project.
3. The tool applies unit costs to the extracted data to calculate the total cost of the project.
4. The tool generates a report that summarizes the total cost of the project, as well as the cost breakdown by category (e.g., materials, labor, equipment).

**3D: Value**

**Business value:** The proposed tool or workflow can create significant value for businesses by helping them to:

* Reduce the risk of cost overruns by providing accurate and up-to-date cost estimates.
* Make better informed decisions about project design and construction methods.
* Improve the efficiency of the cost estimation process.

**Societal value:** The proposed tool or workflow can also contribute to societal value by helping to:

* Reduce waste by optimizing resource utilization.
* Promote sustainable construction practices by incorporating environmental costs into the cost estimation process.
* Improve the affordability of construction projects by making them more cost-effective.

**Conclusion**

The proposed tool or workflow has the potential to offer significant value to both businesses and society by helping to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and promote sustainable construction practices.
