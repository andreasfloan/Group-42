Download the Python script to calculate beam properties.
You can download the Python script to calculate beam properties from the following link:

[link to script]
Save the Python script to a folder.
Save the Python script to a folder on your computer.

Open the IFC model file.
Open the IFC model file that you want to calculate beam properties for.

Open a terminal or command prompt window.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the Python script in the terminal or command prompt window.

Run the Python script.
To run the Python script, type the following command:

python calculate_beam_properties.py <model_file_path>
Replace <model_file_path> with the path to the IFC model file.

Example:

python calculate_beam_properties.py C:\Path\To\Model\Model.ifc
