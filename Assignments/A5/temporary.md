### Your process of developing the tutorial

We believe that the flexibility of the use case selection allowed us to explore an area that we found genuinely interesting, and was relevant to our future careers.
At the same time, it became a challenge for us to choose the path we wanted to go with our work. It was very unclear what was expected of us, so the process of choosing took some time, and it may have been easier with some suggestions. But, in the end we were happy with the open task. 

The course provided a balanced mix of tools, covering essential OpenBIM applications without overwhelming the students. I believe the current selection is appropriate, and further additions should be carefully considered to maintain focus and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. 

### Your recieved feedback on the tutorial

The feedback received on the tutorial was constructive and helped identify areas for improvement. Primarly, we got comments on our targetted learning level, being level 1. Our code were considered a little harder than level 1, and they suggested that we targetted a higher learning level, from 1 to 2. 

### Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

We are not quite sure, but we would be likely to utilize OpenBIM tools in our thesis research in some way. The ability to work with IFC data and integrate with various BIM software applications is highly relevant to our studies and line of work. In conclusion, we are confident that OpenBIM will become increasingly relevant in our professional life as the AEC industry embraces interoperability and collaboration.

### Wrap-up

The A1-A5 assignments have provided a comprehensive learning journey into the world of OpenBIM. We have gained valuable knowledge, skills, and insights into the potential of OpenBIM to transform the architecture, engingeering and construction (AEC) industry. We think that we will be using openBIM at some points in the future as well, and keep learning. The industry is getting more digitalized, so it would be inevitable.
