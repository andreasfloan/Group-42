## A5: Project Reflection

### Our learning experience for the concept we focused on.

Throughout this course, we have gained a better understanding of OpenBIM and its potential application. When we started this we had little understanding of the potential of OpenBIM and how important an IFC file is. We have also got an insight into how modifiable an IFC file is, and that it's only the imagination that's the limit. In our previous experience with BIM we have worked more with modeling in programs like Archicad and Revit. In this course we worked in more detail on how we can program and modify an IFC file on a more advanced level and the opportunities this provides. We have also learned a lot more about what BIM actually means. Previously we looked at BIM as a tool to make or modify projects, but not as much in the meaning of file sharing and to combine different information between different parts of a project.

At the beginning of this course, we had limited exposure to OpenBIM and its applications other than drawing in different programs. However, through the different assignments we have gained a solid foundation in OpenBIM concepts and tools. We can now work with different BIM software applications on a more advanced level, and apply OpenBIM principles in BIM projects in a more detailed way than earlier. To further evolve our BIM competence to a higher level we quickly found out that we need to get a better understanding of coding and developing scripts in programs like Python. We also need to get a better overview of the different possibilities and programs to work with.

We firmly believe that OpenBIM will play a significant role in our future. Its ability to facilitate data exchange, collaboration, and development among different BIM software applications makes it an essential tool for achieving seamless project workflows and efficient design and construction processes. We strongly believe that the BIM journey we have started on is only in the beginning, and later we will be able to learn and program on a higher level. The world of construction is becoming more and more digitalized and it's likely that the knowledge we now have about BIM will be helpful in the future.
