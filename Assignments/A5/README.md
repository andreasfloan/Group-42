## A5: Project Reflection

### Learning Experience

Throughout this course, we have gained a better understanding of OpenBIM and its potential application. When we started this we had little understanding of the potential of OpenBIM and how important an IFC file is. We have also got an insight into how modifiable an IFC file is, and that it's only the imagination that's the limit. In our previous experience with BIM we have worked more with modelling in programs like Archicad and 

### Our Level of Learning

At the beginning of this course, we had limited exposure to OpenBIM and its applications. However, through the different assignments we have gained a solid foundation in OpenBIM concepts and tools. We can now work with different BIM software applications on a more advanced level, and apply OpenBIM principles in BIM projects.

### Future Use of OpenBIM

We firmly believe that OpenBIM will play a significant role in our future. Its ability to facilitate data exchange, collaboration, and development among different BIM software applications makes it an essential tool for achieving seamless project workflows and efficient design and construction processes. It will also play a big part 

### Tutorial Development Process

The process of developing the tutorial was both challenging and rewarding. It required a thorough understanding of the chosen use case, careful selection of appropriate tools, and clear documentation of the workflow. The peer feedback provided valuable insights and suggestions for improvement.

### Course Effectiveness in Answering Thesis Questions

The course has undoubtedly equipped me with the necessary knowledge and skills to address potential thesis questions related to OpenBIM. The hands-on experience gained through the tutorials and assignments has provided me with a foundation for conducting research and developing innovative solutions in the OpenBIM domain.
