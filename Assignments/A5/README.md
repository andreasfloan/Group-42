## A5: Project Reflection

### Our learning experience for the concept we focused on.

Throughout this course, we have gained a better understanding of OpenBIM and its potential application. When we started this we had little understanding of the potential of OpenBIM and how important an IFC file is. We have also got an insight into how modifiable an IFC file is, and that it's only the imagination that's the limit. In our previous experience with BIM we have worked more with modeling in programs like Archicad and Revit. In this course we worked in more detail on how we can program and modify an IFC file on a more advanced level and the opportunities this provides. We have also learned a lot more about what BIM actually means. Previously we looked at BIM as a tool to make or modify projects, but not as much in the meaning of file sharing and to combine different information between different parts of a project.

At the beginning of this course, we had limited exposure to OpenBIM and its applications other than drawing in different programs. However, through the different assignments we have gained a solid foundation in OpenBIM concepts and tools. We can now work with different BIM software applications on a more advanced level, and apply OpenBIM principles in BIM projects in a more detailed way than earlier. To further evolve our BIM competence to a higher level we quickly found out that we need to get a better understanding of coding and developing scripts in programs like Python. We also need to get a better overview of the different possibilities and programs to work with.

We firmly believe that OpenBIM will play a significant role in our future. Its ability to facilitate data exchange, collaboration, and development among different BIM software applications makes it an essential tool for achieving seamless project workflows and efficient design and construction processes. We strongly believe that the BIM journey we have started on is only in the beginning, and later we will be able to learn and program on a higher level. The world of construction is becoming more and more digitalized and it's likely that the knowledge we now have about BIM will be helpful in the future.

### Your process of developing the tutorial

We believe that the flexibility of the use case selection allowed us to explore an area that we found genuinely interesting, and was relevant to our future careers.
At the same time, it became a challenge for us to choose the path we wanted to go with our work. It was very unclear what was expected of us, so the process of choosing took some time, and it may have been easier with some suggestions. But, in the end we were happy with the open task. 

The course provided a balanced mix of tools, covering essential OpenBIM applications without overwhelming the students. I believe the current selection is appropriate, and further additions should be carefully considered to maintain focus and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. 

### Your recieved feedback on the tutorial

The feedback received on the tutorial was constructive and helped identify areas for improvement. Primarly, we got comments on our targetted learning level, being level 1. Our code were considered a little harder than level 1, and they suggested that we targetted a higher learning level, from 1 to 2. 

We were told that the script reflected a more complex and ambitious than we were able to execute in our script. The feedback on the script were helpful, and they had solutions on the faulty parts of our script. We believe that if we had recieved their feedback and help earlier, we could have solved the script.

In assignment 4, which wanted us to make a video to target learners in this subject we had different approaches to the task and how to solve it. We got feedback on how it was very easy for the watcher to follow the presentation. On the other hand, we didn't explain the script and task in the same complexity as our peers, who had a more detailed walkthrough of the script. 

### Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

We are not quite sure, but we would be likely to utilize OpenBIM tools in our thesis research in some way. The ability to work with IFC data and integrate with various BIM software applications is highly relevant to our studies and line of work. In conclusion, we are confident that OpenBIM will become increasingly relevant in our professional life as the AEC industry embraces interoperability and collaboration.

### Wrap-up

The A1-A5 assignments have provided a comprehensive learning journey into the world of OpenBIM. We have gained valuable knowledge, skills, and insights into the potential of OpenBIM to transform the architecture, engingeering and construction (AEC) industry. We think that we will be using openBIM at some points in the future as well, and keep learning. The industry is getting more digitalized, so it would be inevitable.
