# BIM Execution Plan - Structural Capacity Calculation

## Overview

This BIM Execution Plan outlines the process for analyzing an IFC file to calculate the load-bearing capacity of structural elements in a building. The use case is intended for structural engineers, architects, and other professionals involved in structural analysis.

## Use Case Description

The primary objective of this use case is to develop a script that can analyze an IFC file to extract data from various structural elements in the building, specifically 'IfcBeam' elements, and calculate their load-bearing capacity. The script will utilize concepts from ISO 19650 and the IFC schema to achieve this. The following are key aspects of the use case:

### Use Case Audience

This use case is designed for structural engineers, architects, and professionals involved in building analysis and design.

### Disciplinary Expertise

To address this use case, the following disciplinary expertise is required:

- **Structural Analysis:** This involves assessing the dimensions of beams (length, width, height) and determining maximum bending stress. Knowledge of structural analysis and relevant formulas is essential.

- **Material Analysis:** Material properties such as strength, elasticity, and behavior under stress need to be considered.

- **Load-Bearing Analysis:** Understanding of load-bearing principles is crucial for calculating the effects of external loads on structural elements.

### Building Elements of Interest

The focus of this use case is on 'IfcBeam' elements. The script will extract data from these structural elements and perform calculations on their load-bearing properties.

### Prerequisites

Before executing this use case, the following prerequisites should be met:

1. Availability of a valid IFC model that includes 'IfcBeam' elements.

2. Familiarity with the structure and representation of beams within the IFC model.

### Input Data

The primary input data for this use case includes:

- Path to the IFC file that contains the building information, including 'IfcBeam' elements.

- Load information (e.g., applied forces, loads) for structural analysis.

- Material properties (e.g., material strength) for structural calculations.

### Quality Assurance

The following quality assurance measures will be implemented to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the structural capacity calculation script and its outputs:

## Unit Testing

Unit tests will be written to verify the individual functions of the script, including:

- Reading and parsing IFC files
- Extracting data from IFC files, such as the dimensions, material properties, and applied loads for 'IfcBeam' elements
- Conducting structural analysis for 'IfcBeam' elements, including calculating maximum bending stress and load-bearing 
  capacity
- Aggregating the results to provide a comprehensive overview of the load-bearing capacity of all 'IfcBeam' elements in the 
  building

## Integration Testing

Integration tests will be performed to ensure that the script works correctly with other BIM software, such as structural analysis software. This will involve testing the script with a variety of IFC files and comparing the calculated load-bearing capacity values to those obtained from the structural analysis software.

## Acceptance Testing

Users will be involved in the acceptance testing process to ensure that the script meets their needs and requirements. This will involve asking users to test the script with their own IFC files and provide feedback on the results.

In addition to the above measures, the following steps will be taken to ensure the quality of the script:

- The script will be well-documented, including detailed instructions on how to use it, example input data and output 
  results, and a description of the assumptions and limitations of the script.
- The script will be reviewed by other experienced professionals to identify any potential errors or omissions.
- The script will be maintained and updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in the IFC schema and to address any user 
  feedback or bug reports.

By implementing these quality assurance measures, we can ensure that the structural capacity calculation script is a reliable and accurate tool for structural engineers and other professionals involved in building analysis and design.

### Interdependent Use Cases

Completion of this use case can enable other related use cases, including:

1. **Structural Design Optimization:** This use case can be used as a foundation for optimizing the design of structural elements based on their load-bearing capacity.

2. **Safety and Integrity Reporting:** The output of this use case can be used to assess the safety and integrity of the building structure.

3. **Detailed Structural Element Requirements:** A use case can be developed to define specific requirements for different structural elements based on their load-bearing capacity.

## Execution Steps

To achieve the use case objectives, the following steps will be taken:

1. Load the IFC file and extract 'IfcBeam' elements from the model.

2. For each 'IfcBeam' element, gather data such as dimensions (length, width, height), material properties, and applied loads.

3. Conduct structural analysis for each 'IfcBeam' element, including calculating maximum bending stress and load-bearing capacity.

4. Aggregate the results to provide a comprehensive overview of the load-bearing capacity of all 'IfcBeam' elements in the building.

## Conclusion

This BIM Execution Plan provides a roadmap for developing a script that can analyze an IFC file, calculate the load-bearing capacity of 'IfcBeam' elements, and support related use cases in structural engineering and building design. The successful completion of this use case will empower professionals to make informed decisions regarding structural integrity and safety.
