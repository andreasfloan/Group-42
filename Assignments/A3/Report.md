### 3A: Analyze Use Case

**Goal:** To develop a tool or workflow that enables users to calculate the different structural elements of a project from a BIM model.

**Model Use (BIM Uses):** Structural analysis is a critical process in all construction projects. By calculating the strength and stiffness of structural elements, engineers can ensure that the structure will be able to safely support the loads that it will be subjected to. BIM models provide a rich source of data for structural analysis, including information about the geometry, materials, and loading conditions of structural elements.

### 3B: Propose a (Design for a) Tool / Workflow

**Process Diagram:** The following BPMN diagram illustrates the proposed workflow for calculating the structural elements of a project from a BIM model:

[Insert BPMN diagram here]

**Description of the process:**

-The user opens the BIM model in the tool.
-The tool extracts the relevant data from the BIM model, such as the geometry, materials, and loading conditions of --structural elements.
-The tool performs structural analysis calculations using the extracted data.
-The tool generates a report that summarizes the results of the structural analysis, including the calculated internal forces and moments, as well as the stresses and strains in the structural elements.

### 3C: Requirements

**Functional requirements:** The tool or workflow shall be able to:

-Extract the relevant data from a BIM model, including the geometry, materials, and loading conditions of structural elements.
-Perform structural analysis calculations using the extracted data.
-Generate a report that summarizes the results of the structural analysis.
-Non-functional requirements: The tool or workflow shall be:

-Easy to use.
-Efficient.
-Accurate.
-Scalable to handle large BIM models.

### 3D: Value

**Business value:** The proposed tool or workflow can create significant value for businesses by helping them to:

-Reduce the risk of structural failure by providing accurate and up-to-date structural analysis results.
-Make better informed decisions about structural design and construction methods.
-Improve the efficiency of the structural analysis process.

**Societal value:** The proposed tool or workflow can also contribute to societal value by helping to:

-Improve the safety of construction projects.
-Reduce the environmental impact of construction projects by optimizing the design of structural elements.
-Increase the affordability of construction projects by making them more cost-effective.
-Conclusion

The proposed tool or workflow has the potential to offer significant value to both businesses and society by helping to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of construction projects.

In addition to the functional and non-functional requirements listed above, it is also important to consider the following requirements when developing a tool or workflow for calculating the different structural elements in a BIM model:

**Interoperability:** The tool or workflow should be interoperable with different BIM software applications. This will allow users to use the tool or workflow with their preferred BIM software.
**Security:** The tool or workflow should be secure to protect users' data from unauthorized access and modification.
**Customization:** The tool or workflow should be customizable to meet the specific needs of different users and organizations.

By meeting these requirements, a tool or workflow for calculating the different structural elements in a BIM model can be a valuable asset for businesses and organizations involved in the design, construction, and operation of buildings and other infrastructure.
