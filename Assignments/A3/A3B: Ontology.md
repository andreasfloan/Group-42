## Existing Process

The existing process for analyzing IFC files to calculate structural capacity is as follows:

1. Receive IFC file from architect or engineer
2. Check IFC file for completeness and accuracy
3. Import IFC file into BIM software
4. Extract geometry and properties of structural elements
5. Perform structural analysis on extracted geometry and properties
6. Generate report summarizing structural capacity of different elements in building

## Proposed OpenBIM Workflow/Tool

The proposed OpenBIM workflow/tool would automate steps 3-6 of the existing process, allowing users to import the IFC file into the tool/workflow and automatically extract the geometry and properties of structural elements, perform structural analysis, and generate a report.

## Benefits of OpenBIM Workflow/Tool

The proposed OpenBIM workflow/tool would provide the following benefits:

* Reduced time and costs
* Improved accuracy and reliability
* Reduced risk
* Increased collaboration and data sharing

## Conclusion

The proposed OpenBIM workflow/tool has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the structural analysis process, as well as promote collaboration and data sharing across the building industry.
